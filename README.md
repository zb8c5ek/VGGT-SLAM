## Installation of VGGT-SLAM

Clone VGGT-SLAM:

```
git clone https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/VGGT-SLAM
```

```
cd VGGT-SLAM
```

### Create and activate a new conda environment

```
conda create -n vggt-slam python=3.11
```

```
conda activate vggt-slam
```

### Run the setup script
This step will automatically download all 3rd party packages including Perception Encoder, SAM 3, and our fork of VGGT. More details on the license for Perception Encoder
can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/perception_models/blob/main/LICENSE.PE), for SAM3 can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam3/blob/main/LICENSE), and for VGGT can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggt/blob/main/LICENSE.txt). Note that we only use SAM 3 and Perception Encoder for optional open-set 3D object detection.

**Linux / macOS:**
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

> For a full Windows walkthrough (GTSAM build, CUDA, troubleshooting) see [local_install.md](local_install.md).

## Quick Start

run `python main.py --image_folder /path/to/image/folder --max_loops 1 --vis_map` replacing the image path with your folder of images. 
This will create a visualization in viser which shows the incremental construction of the map.

As an example, we provide a folder of test images in `office_loop.zip` which will generate the following map. Using the default parameters will
result in a single loop closure towards the end of the trajectory. Unzip the folder and set its path as the arguments for `--image_folder`, e.g.,

```
unzip office_loop.zip
```

and then run the below command:

```
python3 main.py --image_folder office_loop --max_loops 1 --vis_map
```

Use the `--run_os` flag to enable 3D open-set object detection. This will prompt the user for text queries and plot a 3D bounding box of the detection on the map in viser. The office loop scene does not have very many interesting objects, but some example queries that can be used are "coffee machine", "sink", "printer", "cone", and "refrigerator." For some example scenes with more interesting objects, check out the Clio apartment and cubicle scene which can be downloaded 
from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/5bkv8rsa2xvwmvom6bmza/AOc8VW71kuZCgQjcw_REbWA?rlkey=wx1njghufcxconm1znidc1hgw&e=1&st=c809h8h3&dl=0).

### Collecting Custom Data

To quickly collect a test on a custom dataset, you can record a trajectory with a cell phone and convert the MOV file to a folder of images with:

```
mkdir <desired_location>/img_folder
```

And then, run the command below:

```
ffmpeg -i /path/to/video.MOV -vf "fps=10" <desired_location>/img_folder/frame_%04d.jpg
```
Note while vertical cell phone videos can work, to avoid images being cropped it is recommended to use horizontal videos. 

### Adjusting Parameters

See main.py or run `--help` from main.py to view all parameters.

## Running Evaluations

To automatically run evaluation on TUM and 7-Scenes datasets, first install the datasets using the provided download instructions from [MASt3R-SLAM](https://github.com/rmurai0610/MASt3R-SLAM?tab=readme-ov-file#examples). Set the download location of MASt3R-SLAM by setting *abs_dir* in the bash scripts 
*/evals/eval_tum.sh* and */evals/eval_7scenes.sh*

#### In Tum Dataset

To run on TUM, run `./evals/eval_tum.sh <w>` and then run `python evals/process_logs_tum.py --submap_size <w>` to analyze and print the results, where w is 
the submap size, for example:

```
./evals/eval_tum.sh 32
```

```
python evals/process_logs_tum.py --submap_size 32
```

To visualize the maps as they being constructed, inside the bash scripts add `--vis_map`. This will update the viser map each time the submap is updated. 

## News and Updates
* May 2025: VGGT-SLAM 1.0 is released
* August 2025: SL(4) optimization is integrated into the official GTSAM repo
* September 2025: VGGT-SLAM 1.0 Accepted to Neurips 2025
* November 2025: VGGT-SLAM 1.0 Featured in MIT News [article](https://news.mit.edu/2025/teaching-robots-to-map-large-environments-1105)
* January 2026: VGGT-SLAM 2.0 is released

## Todo

- [ ] Release real-time code. This code enables plugging in a Real Sense Camera and incrementally constructing a map 
as the camera explored a scene. This has been tested on a Jetson Thor onboard a robot.
- [ ] Add optional code to sparsify the visualized map as visualizing large point cloud maps can slow down the code.
